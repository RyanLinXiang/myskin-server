# myskin REST-API server

## Description

This is the REST-API server for "mySkin" - a German React Native app to detect skin cancer (melanoma) from a mole image uploaded by the user. 
The app repo can be found [here](http://github.com/RyanLinXiang/myskin). The app is a proof-of-concept and the first React native app known to include a locally saved and run AI model, imported with TensorflowJS. 

Beside the AI part, the app offers many information, real-time UV index, reminder function for the next skin screening and a discussion forum. 
Primarily for the discussion forum this REST API back-end was written to allow CRUD actions. Furthermore it also includes basic login/register functionalities based on JWT tokens.

The app is part of the final project of an intense 3-months bootcamp on JavaScript and should not only showcase what has been learned but also what is possbile nowadays with this powerful programming language.
